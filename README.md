#  Life in Literacy

A simulation to help youth understand the importance of financial literacy. Made for Ellehacks 2021!

## Description

Life in Literacy is a simulator that allows users to experience real life situations and make decisions that affect their spending and saving. The more financially literate decisions you make, the better off you will become as you progress through the levels (representing different stages of life).

## Navigation

When you first enter the web-app, you are greeted with a spunky landing page. Once you click the <b>START SIMULATION</b> button, a pop-up with the instuctions and a few words from the creators (us!) will appear. After you close the pop-up, the simulation will officially begin. <br/>
You will start out as a high schooler with a few hundred dollars saved. You will be able to track your level and amount at anytime on the left side. You will go through several situations that will require you to make a decision to spend. After you finish a certain number of situations, you will 'level up' to become a university/college student (should you decide to enroll in a post-secondary institute), and then again to become a working adult. Based on real statistics, you will be forced to spend money on rent, food, and other necessaties. Once you have completed the simulation, you will be able to view your final amount saved. A final message will appear from the creators (us, again!) highlighting the importance of maintaining a balance and making smart, concious financial decisions. <br/>
There is no way to "win" the game: Our end-goal is to solely illuminate the benefits of being financially literate and inspire the user to take control of their own financial situation. We believe that finishing the simulation with the maximum amount of money is not all there is to life. It is up to the user to determine the value of their end-result and make their real-life changes accordingly.

## Inspiration

We, the creators, were inspired to make the game after realizing the evident gap in students' knowledge when it comes to financial literacy. Often, many of the decisions (or lack of) we make as univeristy students will affect our future and may hinder our ability to become financially stable or secure. We wanted to make a simulation that would be engaging for the user, but also teach some very important lessons. We were inspired by the infamous <a href="https://www.episodeinteractive.com/">Episode</a> app to create a simulation that is based on scenarios and decisions that the user has to make that affects their final outcome, for better or <i>for worse</i>.

## Technology Stack

We created Life in Literacy using a React front-end and Java Springboot back-end.
For the front-end, we also used Chakra-UI components.
Special credits to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RA5NpxbioI">this youtube video</a> for a stellar tutorial on how to create a React-Java Springboot web-app!

## Next Steps

Though it is surely important to save money, we also believe balance is key. Though a user, who has the sole aim of being financially stable, may choose to opt out of any events that may require them to spend, they might also lose out on forming any sort of interpersonal relationship and lack a social life. Thus, a future improvement to our simulation is to factor in certain variables, such as the number of friends you make/lose. <br/>
